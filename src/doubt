1) make it dynamic with height, width, fill props
2) if disabled, onclick should not happen. Need a condition here.
3) check styles for disabled dates, months list, years list
4) selected value can be of boolean type, boolean(false) will become false and filled won't work
5) this must be a boolean condition, and rename to "bordered". border styles must be set predefined
6) don't use top, left, right, bottom while transitioning. Use transform. This is smoothen the animationon
